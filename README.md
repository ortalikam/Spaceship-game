# Spaceship-game


Game Instructions:
The user plays with the spaceship by moving with arrows:
- Right arrow - the spacecraft moves to the right
- Left arrow - the spacecraft moves to the left
- Up arrow spacecraft shoots
The shot goes out from the center of the spacecraft and from its upper part (the bow), the speed of the shot as desired, but the speed is constant.
The enemy spaceships come from above randomly as you wish.
The speed of the enemy spaceships is fixed as desired.
 There are 3 types of enemy spaceships:
1. Normal enemy spacecraft (listed as "enemy space" )
2. Enemy space commander
3. Enemy ship A mother ship
The probability of reaching a normal enemy spacecraft is 70%, the probability of a commander's spacecraft is 20% and the probability of a ship being 10%.
The appearance of the ships is of course different (but it can be assumed that their size is the same).

Below the game area is a table for the current game data, the table shows the vulnerability for each type of spacecraft relative to the number of spacecraft that appeared. For every damage to an enemy spacecraft, the following points are given:
Normal enemy spacecraft - 10 points
Command spacecraft - 25 points
Mother ship - 50 points
The user should be presented with a summary of the points and the vulnerability along with details of the vulnerability in space.
After 100 appearances of enemy spaceships, the game will be stopped and it will be possible to start it again.
